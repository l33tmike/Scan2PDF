Scan2PDF is a simple piece of software that allows an image passed to it to be written to a PDF, recompressed as JPEG. 
The location the files will be saved to and the JPEG compression ratio are customisable. All saved files are keyed with the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH.MM.SS.pdf"

I created this to fill a space that was needed from the scanning software that came with my printer/scanner - the PDFs it generated has lossless TIFFs embedded and as such generated huge PDFs! It also did not lend itself to remote scanning, despite having a network connection - this allows network scanning, which dumps all PDFs in a common location to pick up at a later date.
